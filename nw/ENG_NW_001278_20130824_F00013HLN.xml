Second suspect of Mumbai gangrape arrested, 3 others still wanted

MUMBAI, Aug. 24 (Xinhua) -- The second suspect of the Mumbai gangrape case was arrested by local police and the remaining three are still being hunted, local media CNN-IBN reported Saturday.

The incident, which brought back the horrific memories of a similar attack in New Delhi on Dec. 16, 2012, took place on Thursday around 6.30 p.m. when the victim and her colleague were on a photo assignment and went to the sprawling ruins of Shakti Mills Compound near the Mahalaxmi railway station.

A massive hunt is on for the remaining three alleged perpetrators who are on the run. The first accused in the case was arrested on Friday and had reportedly confessed to his crime while he also identified the other four.  Enditem
