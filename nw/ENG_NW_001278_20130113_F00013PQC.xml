Police arrest 6 men for gangraping housewife in northern India

NEW DELHI, Jan. 13 (Xinhua) -- Indian police have arrested six men for allegedly gangraping a 29-year-old housewife on a bus in the northern state of Punjab Friday, a case almost similar to last year's horrific gangrape of a 23-year-old medical student in the national capital, a police official said Sunday.

"The gruesome incident happened in a remote village near the city of Amritsar late Friday night. The victim was on way to her village on the bus when the driver and conductor abducted her and took her to an undisclosed location where they and their five accomplices took turns to rape her before dumping her near her village," the official said, on condition of anonymity.

Six of the seven accused have been arrested and a manhunt has been launched to track down the seventh accused who is on the run since the incident came to light, he said.

The latest case came barely a month after the Delhi University student was gangraped by six men on a moving bus in the national capital. She and her boyfriend, who had boarded the bus after watching a movie at a multiplex, were also beaten up mercilessly before being thrown off the vehicle.

Earlier this month, the 23-year-old student succumbed to her injuries at a hospital in Singapore, where she was flown in after her condition worsened at a government hospital in the Indian capital.

All the accused are currently in judicial custody facing rape and murder charges which carry a maximum punishment of death penalty.  Enditem
