Austria announces 2 mln euros further funding for Syrian refugees

VIENNA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Austria has increased its funding for the Syrian refugee crisis by 2 million euros, Vice-Chancellor and Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger said Tuesday.

"The already more than two-year-long conflict in Syria continues to take a higher death toll and has destroyed the livelihoods of millions of people," he said following cabinet.

He added that neighboring countries were under pressure from an increasing number of refugees, something he saw first-hand during a visit to a refugee camp in Lebanon last week, and that led to the decision to increase the funding, the Foreign Ministry stated in a press release.

1.1 million euros of the total will go to the UN Refugee Agency UNHCR in light of United Nations calls for aid for Syrian refugees in the region, while the remaining 900,000 euros will go to projects run by Austrian non-governmental organizations in neighbouring states.

The announcement brings the total amount of Austrian humanitarian funding to the region to around 6 million euros, including 300,000 euros in food aid from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Environment and Water Management, along with non-monetary services provided by the Interior Ministry.
