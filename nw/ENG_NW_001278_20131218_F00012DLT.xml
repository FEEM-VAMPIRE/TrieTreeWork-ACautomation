EU provides 147 mln euro to Syrian crisis affected

BRUSSELS, Dec. 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Union on Wednesday signed three major contracts with the United Nations agencies totalling 147 million euros (201 million U.S. dollars) to deliver vital aid to people directly affected by the Syrian crisis.

Heads of the UN Refugee Agency, the UN World Food Program and UNICEF, who met with the EU Humanitarian Aid Commissioner Kristalina Georgieva in Brussels, participated in a signing ceremony for the humanitarian funding.

"The conflict in Syria has consumed tens of thousands of lives, uprooted millions from their homes, destabilised the region and consigned an entire generation of the young to an uncertain future," said European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso.

"It is right that we stand up for the victims of this catastrophe, which is why I am proud that today we are signing some of the largest humanitarian contracts ever concluded with trusted humanitarian partners," he said.

"I urge the international community to follow suit and replicate our gesture of solidarity," he added.

Georgieva said the contracts would help "to reach even more vulnerable Syrians and those in the host communities beyond Syria's borders who are struggling under the burden of their generous hospitality."

In Syria, the humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate dramatically as violence has intensified and fighting continues to spread throughout the country.

The United Nations estimates that 9.3 million people are affected by the ongoing violence, with approximately 6.5 million people internally displaced. Every day of violence adds to this number.  Enditem
