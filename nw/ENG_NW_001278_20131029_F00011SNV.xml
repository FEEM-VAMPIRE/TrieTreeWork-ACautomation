Kenya sacks 2 soldiers over looting at Westgate mall after attack

NAIROBI, Oct. 29 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's military chief said Tuesday two soldiers had been sacked and jailed for looting goods and money during the terrorist attack at Westgate shopping mall in the capital Nairobi last month.

Chief of Defense Forces General Julius Karangi told a news conference in Nairobi that some of the Kenya Defense Forces (KDF) soldiers took part in the looting at the upscale shopping mall during the four-day siege.

"Discipline is our core driving point and we are not playing with this issue. That is why we have taken action on these soldiers. Two of them have been jailed and dismissed while a third one is under probe," Karangi told journalists in Nairobi.

He said the two soldiers who have been dismissed from duty were found with stolen property from the Westgate mall, adding that one of the soldiers is still being probed over the incident.

Karangi said the soldiers were found with mobile phones, cameras and chargers that were "stolen" from the mall during the siege.

The development came after Defense Cabinet Secretary Rachael Omamo ordered investigations into the looting claims, warning that the government will deal firmly with any soldier involved in the alleged looting spree.  Enditem
