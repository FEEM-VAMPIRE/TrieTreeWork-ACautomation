Coach Santana sacked by Bahia

RIO DE JANEIRO, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Former South Africa national coach Joel Santana has been sacked by Brazilian top-flight outfit Bahia.

His dismissal followed the club's 7-3 defeat to local rivals Vitoria on Sunday and comes just five weeks after he took charge of the club for a fourth time.

Bahia won just one of seven matches since Santana took up the position.

"I thank the Bahia fans, the club's board and especially president Marcelo Guimaraes Filho, who have always supported me to try to get the results we wanted," Santana said on Monday.

Bahia are yet to appoint a replacement but confirmed the position will be temporarily filled by assistant coach Eduardo Barroca.

Santana, 64, took charge of South Africa in 2008 but was sacked the following year after a run of eight defeats in nine matches. Enditem
