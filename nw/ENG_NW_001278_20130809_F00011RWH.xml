Spain to revise rail speed limit in wake of deadly July crash

MADRID, Aug. 9 (Xinhua) -- Spain would revise maximum speed limits of the country's rail network in the wake of a train crash killed 79 people last month, Spanish minister of public works Ana Pastor said on Friday.

"Everything is under review and subject to proposals for improvement," Pastor told a parliamentary panel about the July 24 crash near Santiago de Compostela.

The eight carriage train was traveling at more than twice the speed limit of 80 kilometers per hour on a steep curve when it flew off the tracks.

Engine driver Francisco Jose Garzon Amo was allegedly on the telephone with the on-board conductor and stopped speaking just 11 seconds before the accident.

According to Pastor, the Spanish government might lower speed limits on stretches regarded as risky and improve the country's rail signaling network. It will also upgrade the advance warning system on trains, which could be extended to include satellite-based technology.

The use of mobile phones by RENFE personnel will also be limited, while luggage storage space will be adapted so that bags and cases are not converted into dangerous flying objects as the result of an accident.  Enditem
