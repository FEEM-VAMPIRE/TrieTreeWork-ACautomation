Indian police to produce 2nd suspect in Mumbai gangrape in court

NEW DELHI, Aug. 24 (Xinhua) -- Indian police will bring the second suspect arrested in the case of gangrape of a woman photographer on Thursday in Mumbai to court later on Saturday, while looking for three other suspects.

Police nabbed Vijay Jadhav, a school dropout in Mumbai's Dombivali district, from a video parlor early Saturday. On Friday afternoon, police arrested the first suspect, Chand Abdul Sattar, and brought him to court Saturday, said police.

A 22-year-old photojournalist was gangraped by five men in a deserted textile mill in central Mumbai on Thursday. Her colleague was tied by the assaulters.

Twenty police teams, including 10 from the crime branch, are tracking down the other three suspects, all identified and aged between 18 and 20.

The gangrape triggered anger in India as it was reminiscent of the horrific gangrape and killing of a 23-year-old medical student on a moving bus in Delhi last December.

The Delhi gangrape saw similar scenario as the victim's boyfriend was also tied and beaten up by the rapists. The case is still pending in court and none of the six accused has been tried yet.  Enditem@
