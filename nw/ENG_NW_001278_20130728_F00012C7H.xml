Relatives of Asiana crash victims leave for China

SAN FRANCISCO, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Relatives of three Chinese teenager girls, who were killed in an Asiana airliner crash three weeks ago, left for home on Saturday.

Chinese Vice Consul General in San Francisco Yi Xianrong saw the group of 10 Chinese off at the airport, said a spokesman of the Chinese Consulate General in San Francisco.

A total of 141 Chinese were aboard the ill-fated Asiana Airlines Flight 241, which broke off its tail and burst into flames after it veered off the runway upon landing at the San Francisco International Airport on July 6.

Two female students from a middle school in east China's Zhejiang province were killed in the tragedy. Another girl died from severe injuries sustained in the crash on July 12.  Enditem
