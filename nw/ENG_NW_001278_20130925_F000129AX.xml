Russian rights ombudsman calls for leniency for Greenpeace activists

MOSCOW, Sept. 24 (Xinhua) -- Environmentalists from the Greenpeace organization should not be punished too severely for the rally they have organized at a Russian oil sea platform, the country's Human Rights Commissioner Vladimir Lukin said Tuesday.

While calling the Greenpeace's attempt to land on the oil platform in the northern Pechora Sea "eccentric," Lukin urged the Russian authorities to realize these activists "nevertheless had admirable and noble motives."

"I hope that our authorities ... will act according to the mildest option permitted by the law," the Interfax news agency quoted Lukin as saying.

Greenpeace's Arctic Sunrise ship escorted by the Russian border guards arrived at the port of Murmansk by the White Sea on Tuesday. Lawyers hired by Greenpeace have rushed there to assist the detained environmentalists.

Thirty environmentalists were detained on Sept. 18-19 while they were attempting to stage a protest against oil extraction on the Prirazlomnaya oil platform stationed in the exclusive Russian economic zone.

Moscow insists the actions of the Greenpeace activists in the Pechora Sea were an act of provocation and piracy. The Russian Investigative Committee has opened a criminal inquiry into the incident.  Enditem
