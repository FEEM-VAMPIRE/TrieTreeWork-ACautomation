Turkish interior minister urges protesters to leave Gezi Park

ISTANBUL, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Interior Minister Muammer Guler issued Thursday a warning to protesters staging anti- government demonstration in Istanbul, saying the situation at Gezi Park "could not continue in this way."

The minister indicated that the government may take major action to move protesters out of the Gezi Park, where about 1,000 people have staged the protests for 17 days.

"Although Gezi Park is open to public, our friends (the protesters) have been living there in their tents 24 hours a day since June 1... Gezi Park cannot continue in this way," Guler told reporters.

The minister reiterated the government's call for protesters to differentiate themselves from "provocateurs, marginal and illegal parties" at the park.

Some groups attempted to burn tents in Gezi Park, but the police had prevented it, he said, adding the police would continue their intervention if "marginal groups" keep clashing with them.

He went on saying that a referendum on the future of Gezi Park will be held either in the Beyoglu district or in wider Istanbul.

The demonstrations centered in the Taksim Square in Istanbul continues Thursday despite a referendum proposal by the government a day earlier for a controversial redevelopment plan in Gezi Park.

The clashes between police and protesters have killed at least five people, including a policeman, and injured 5,000 people, according to local media.  Enditem
