Some 6.8 million people need aid in Syria: UN relief office

UNITED NATIONS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- About 6.8 million Syrians need humanitarian assistance and another 1.8 million people have fled the conflict-stricken country since the crisis erupted more than two years ago, a UN spokesman said here Tuesday.

"So far this year, UN agencies and humanitarian partners have organized 21 cross-line convoys and reached nearly 1.8 million people with food, water and health supplies in hard-to-reach areas, " Eduardo del Buey, the deputy UN spokesman, said at a daily news briefing.

The World Food Programme, working with 22 local non- governmental organizations, has provided 2.4 million people with food assistance so far this month, he said, adding that the World Health Organization and its partners have provided primary health care and medical supplies throughout the Middle East country.

"More than 153,000 children have received medical check-ups through 51 UNICEF-supported mobile medical teams in all fourteen Governorates," he said, referring to mobile medical teams backed by the UN Children's Fund.

The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) has provided more than 1.4 million people with essential aid, including cash assistance, across Syria this year, he said. "With the Ministry of Health, they have airlifted essential medical equipment and supplies to Qamishly airport for people in hard-to-reach cities in the northeast of Syria."  Enditem
