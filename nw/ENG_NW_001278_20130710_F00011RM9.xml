Death toll from Turkey's Gezi Park protests rises to six

ANKARA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Death toll from Turkey's Gezi Park protests rose to six after a university student died of his wounds on Wednesday, local media said.

Ali Ismail Korkmaz, 19, who was beaten by unidentified people last month during the anti-government protests, died from his injuries, private Dogan News Agency reported.

Korkmaz joined the demonstrations in the central Anatolian city of Eskisehir and sustained a brain hemorrhage when unknown people attacked him while he was trying to escape from tear gas on June 2, said the report, adding that his assailants have not been arrested yet.

The Gezi Park protests, ongoing for more than a month, have also left dozens of people seriously injured due to police heavy- handed measures.

The protests began in Turkey's biggest city of Istanbul as a peaceful sit-in aiming to preserve Gezi Park on May 31, but soon snowballed into a national movement against Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government due to its harsh crackdown.

Clashes between police and protesters across the country killed at least six people, including a policeman, and injured some 5,000. Enditem`[#+
