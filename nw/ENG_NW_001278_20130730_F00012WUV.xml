17 detained after new protests at Istanbul's Gezi Park

ANKARA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Seventeen people, including a German citizen, were detained following a new protest at Istanbul' s Gezi Park on Tuesday, Turkish Anadolu Agency reported.

On early Tuesday, a group of people began lying down on the ground at the Gezi Park, the report said. The police force then swept the park and detained 17 protesters.

The German citizen named Muller was reportedly chanting in English and German as he was hauled away by the police. In addition to the protests at Gezi, a wave of raids hit five cities across Turkey on Tuesday as well, with several people being detained in connection with previous protests.

The protests began in Turkey's biggest city of Istanbul as a peaceful sit-in aiming to preserve Gezi Park on May 31, but soon snowballed into a national movement against Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government due to its harsh crackdown.

Clashes between police and protesters across the country killed at least six people, including a policeman, and injured some 5,000. Enditem
