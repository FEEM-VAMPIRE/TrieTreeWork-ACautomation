Chinese-built primary school opens in Harare

HARARE, Feb. 6 (Xinhua) -- A primary school that was built by the Chinese government in Harare has started operating, Zimbabwe's Minister of Education, Sport, Arts and Culture David Coltart said on Wednesday.

The school was built at the same time with the one in Bindura which opened in 2011.

Bindura, located 80 kilometers north east of Harare, is the provincial capital of Mashonaland Central Province.

Coltart told Xinhua that the Harare school opened on Jan. 26.

The two schools are part of the eight cooperation programs that China promised to undertake in Zimbabwe under the framework of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC).

Some of the projects have since been completed and these include an agricultural demonstration center and a friendship hospital.

Launched in 2000 by China and African countries, FOCAC has become an integral platform to enhance trade and cooperation between the two sides.  Enditem
