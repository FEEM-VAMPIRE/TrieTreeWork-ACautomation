Kenya's military probes looting at Westgate shopping mall

NAIROBI, Oct. 3 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya Defense Forces (KDF) said Thursday it has launched investigations into weather its soldiers were involved in the looting of property at the Westgate shopping mall after terror attack last month.

CCTV footage from the mall shows that some soldiers took part in looting after the army took over Westgate operation from the police on Saturday night. Three soldiers are seen walking out of the Nakumatt supermarket with plastic shopping bags filled with cash.

The reports of looting were roundly condemned by Kenyans including those who lost their belongings in the mall.

In a statement, Cabinet Secretary for Defense Reychelle Omamo called on the public to share information of any unprofessional conduct by its officers during the operation.

Over 70 people were killed during the attack by Al-Qaida related militants, and dozens more are missing.  Enditem
