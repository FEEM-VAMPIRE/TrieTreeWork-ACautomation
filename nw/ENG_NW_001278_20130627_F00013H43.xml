11 arrested in western Turkey for provoking Gezi Park protests

ANKARA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Eleven out of 13 people, who had been detained in Izmir province of western Turkey for provoking Gezi Park protests, were sent to jail pending trial on Thursday, local Today's Zaman reported.

The Izmir court that issued the order said the suspects are accused of provoking protests, damaging public and private property, joining a terrorist organization and attacking police officers.

The protests began in Turkey's biggest city of Istanbul as an attempt to preserve Gezi Park on May 31 and quickly snowballed into widespread demonstrations against Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's leadership.  Clashes between police and protesters across the country have killed at least five people, including a policeman, and injured some 5,000.  Enditem
