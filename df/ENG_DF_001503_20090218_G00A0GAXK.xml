I thought I just heard on the news that there's 'talk' of releasing the Yorkshire Ripper, as doctors have been 'reported' as saying he no longer poses a threat?

WTF? :curse:

Cheers Ray, but it looks to me from the Currant Bun link that this is a potential step towards eventual freedom for the wanker. That's just not right, surely? He should be eating maggots and drinking piss. :curse:

He should rot in hell.

I watched a documentry about him recently, after he was arrested he convinced doctors he suffered from schizophrenia, when in fact he was as sane as the next man, he is just an evil bastard, he knew what he was doing when he murdered those women, it was his wife who suffered from schizophrenia, he had mastered her behaviour for years &amp; was able to convince the doctors who assessed him at the time.. <img src="http://britishexpats.com/forum/images/smilies/frown.gif"/>

I honestly doubt he'll be out anytime soon. He's starting on the road to release. Thats the problem of imprisoning murderers as nutters, doctors just love to cure people.
