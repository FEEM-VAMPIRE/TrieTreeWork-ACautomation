Let us know who you will vote for and why.

It’s got to the The Donald, because America doesn’t need a wheezing, hoarse, coughing, bug-eyed, eye-rolling, inappropriately cackling, under investigation, ethically challenged, intelligence mishandling, top-secret erasing, false under-fire claiming, skeletally-adorned in the closet, with serial rapist husband in tow, and Wall-Street controlled to-boot President — prone to spontaneous negro dialect, and as the movie-blamer who excuses the death of American servicemen that she was in part responsible for with the statement, WHAT DIFFERENCE, AT THIS POINT, DOES IT MAKE?!

And after the greased pig squeezed out of justice’s grasp once again, she partied hearty. Hillary: I "Sat Around Eating Indian Food And Drinking Wine And Beer"

Voted other. I'm writing in Tom Brady if that's the ballot that appears in front of me in November.

**** both Clinton and Trump.

If you aren't voting for either candidate, then stay at home. The lines will already be long enough. Right? Unless that was sarcasm?

When a person comes on boisterous and loud and demanding and won't get quiet and sit down when asked, they rightly get the boot. black, white or Martian.

What is your point. Mine is that this interaction wouldn't have happened at any other candidate's speaking event.

Sanders was a denied the podium at an event he didn't organize. The BLM Seattle protest happened at a event set up to celebrate the 80th anniversary of Social Security. Bernie Sanders was a guest of the Washington Community Action Network.

as much as I like Bernie the man is losing because just like at the podium, he is too nice, he could have taken out Hillary if only his back bone was strong enough, instead he decided to be "nice" &amp; is on his way out for his efforts.

Sanders is losing because the full weight of the Democratic Party machine is against him. All the way back to the false campaign database accusations. From the beginning. He is doing very well all things considered.
