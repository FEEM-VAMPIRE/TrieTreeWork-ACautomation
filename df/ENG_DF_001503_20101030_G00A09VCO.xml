Strange how 'Ordinary' Muslims say they are not the same as the extremists yet the message given out seems to have gone out to all corners of the globe to insult etc ordinary 'other' natioinalities and religions.And they 'enjoyed it'. Gives out a positive message to those who believe there is no threat from Muslims, in general ! <img src="http://britishexpats.com/forum/images/smilies/frown.gif"/>

Sort of, if people are stupid enough to go in for that kind of thing, someone will probably take the piss out of them.

it would be nice if you could nip over to the other thread and give your expert opinion on wether a bacteria could evolve to consume the leaked oil.
I'm guessing a marine biologist might know?
