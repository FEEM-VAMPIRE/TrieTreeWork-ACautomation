Didn't anyone tell him a little corruption is perfectly acceptable for a NSW politican? Its only a bottle of wine.

A liberal politician with integrity? How the hell did he ever get through the selection process?

Who's betting his replacement is worse?

Yeah this sounds very suspect. I wonder was the letter code for thanks for something else.

Actually resigned when being caught doing something wrong/illegal/immoral/etc.

I think wishing for a 'liberal' politician, or indeed any politician, with actual integrity, is like wishing for a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.

Need to set sights on the credible.

Surely if he truly had integrity he would a) not have lied to the commission or b) declared the wine when given it.

Admittedly, he demonstrated *some* integrity by not clinging on with all 20 fingers and toes until someone came along and stamped on them, so I'll give you that. <img src="http://britishexpats.com/forum/images/smilies/biggrin.gif"/>

To be fair, he didn't admit to being found out. He admitted to having a massive memory failure. It makes it dodgy as a memory failure is forgiveable.

Yeah, but he didn't claim the note was a forgery and have the reporters concerned arrested as part of a criminal conspiracy. I can think of a few liberal politicians who would have....

So in relative terms, he's got integrity <img src="http://britishexpats.com/forum/images/smilies/sunglasses.gif"/>

It doesn't seem right that Barry O'Farrell should resign over this when you consider what happened in NSW, for 20 years, under a Labour government. Nothing ever got to ICAC. The funny thing was that after each election you could never find anyone who would admit to voting for them.

Unless this move is part of a massive cover up which he wants to deflect attention from. I think I've watched too much House of Cards.

Labor lover

Its a real shame. He really got NSW going. There's a lot going on and a lot in the pipeline due to Barry.

Something labor never did.

Anything is a real winner, when you are coming off 10 years of nothing. <img src="http://britishexpats.com/forum/images/smilies/wink.gif"/>

Typical dodgy liberal politician....similar to the Tories in the UK.

They seem to think the rules only apply to other people..not them.

Leopards never change their spots
