I thought it was the "Happiest Place on Earth".

I'm going to venture to guess that when this dude joined the force he never imagined his photo of him arresting a mouse would end up in the news! However, the alternative is tasing (?) or beating so this is not a bad tradeoff.

I worked there through college, and no, it isn't a 'happy place' internally. It's a business, plain and simple.

That's not what got 'em.

From the news article posted by iJohnHenry above:

<quote>
"The protesters were arrested on a misdemeanour count of failure to obey a police officer and two traffic infractions."
