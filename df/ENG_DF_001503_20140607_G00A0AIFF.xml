The Moncton shooter is arrested. The question is will he survive at the hands of the RCMP? There must be some fairly upset and angry officers there, and let's face it, Canadian cops are not quite as restrained as their British counterparts. Time will tell. (Not that I have sympathy for him.)

No countries filth is that stupid - even the RCMP.

They had a chance when he was arrested as nobody was looking like with that mendez chap. Now though? It's gonna have to be the due process he's entitled too.

I was thinking he might "slip" while walking to his cell, that sort of thing.

I'm fairly confident that that sort of thing goes on a lot. This is too high profile though - in fact I can imagine that they'll have to make sure he doesn't have any accidents just to avoid the accusations.

Given Canada's bizarre justice system, he will probably be given bail for a few months until his trial...
