Pilgrimage is now such a huge movement of people from all over that you should expect an epidemic of weird viruses. When I worked in Jeddah we always expected to get "Haj Flu" at the time of the mass movement to the Holy City.

That is funny mate. This news you put up is from last years’s Haj!! I think you forgot to read the date. Next Haj will be in 9 months time, and in anyhow, it is not only during Haj that people gather in a huge number in that area, many Muslims all over the world go to Mekkah during the last ten days of Ramdan as well, and during that period the number of people easily reaches two millions.

The proponents of organized religion will never publickly admit the truth because to do so would deprive them of a powerfull weapon/tool.

I am Agnostic. I do not claim to know whether there is or isn't an all powerfull entity watching over us and interfering in human life either now or in the past.

My previous post was in response to Meow's post, because when I read the title of this thread I had the exact same thought as Meow.

So what excuse/mental gymnastics do religious Muslims give to the rationalist who will point to the cornovirus afflicting pilgrims and ask how come Allah allows his believers, who have converged in Saudi to worship him, to be afflicted by this virus? Allah is all powerfull and has directly interfered in human society in the past and Muslims endlessly claim actions and deeds as the will of Allah, so what's the deal here?
