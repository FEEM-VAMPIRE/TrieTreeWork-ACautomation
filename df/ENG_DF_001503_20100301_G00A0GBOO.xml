The Home Office should just stop his appeal now so as to not waste anymore of the tax payer's money on this piece of shit.

The time he has spent inside roughly equates to 2 years per woman he killed.

It costs something like 50k a year to keep him in Broadmoor and only around 12p to make one 9mm round which should be deposited squarely in his ****ing forehead.

I don’t normally support the death penalty, but in some cases it is probably the best solution. Keeping him alive in Broadmoor is probably more cruel and pointless than ending his life., and the world is safer with him gone.

Let him out, he was innocent !! A complete fit up. His human rights have been violated time and time again whilst being detained illegally.
He has been a classic, normal, run of the mill guy, who obviously had evidence planted on him.

Perhaps Dogbye is right.

He could be usefully reintroduced to society. He could be chief negotiator with the Argentineans over the future of the Falkland Isles.

Hello Mrs. Kirchner, meet Mr. Sutcliff.

It all sounds very good. But the only western industrialised country that's still killing the killers in the stupid belief it actually works, has far different figures. It actually costs more to execute than to keep in prison here. FACT.

This is a serious point from me.

I had a girlfriend who was later found guilty of murder. The evidence was totally circumstantial, and in my (perhaps biased) view not beyond reasonable doubt. She has always claimed her innocence, and because of that she was give a stinging sentence. She currently holds the longest sentence in the state.

She is a 110% supporter of the death penalty. When I asked why, she said “because juries are more realistic when they think you will hang”.

You cannot argue with her words. She had the most to lose.

I can PM anyone details if they want.

Given that the Uk used to do it within the month the costs here would be cheaper
