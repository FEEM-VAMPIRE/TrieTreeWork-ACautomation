I don't usually worry about incidents on an aircraft, but I must admit that there appear to be many on the 787. Lets not forget though that the DC-10 killed people on multiple occasions with its non-pressure sealed cargo door, and it went on to have a long career carrying passengers.

Whoa... <img src="http://britishexpats.com/forum/images/smilies/ohmy.gif"/>

I might think twice, as well... Well at least until they work out the kinks!

When the pilots refuse to fly them, then you worry. <img src="http://britishexpats.com/forum/images/smilies/rofl.gif"/>

Apparently some news stations were duped into displaying some rather crude if racist crew names.

My wife sent me that, I wasn't sure the casual racism would be received well on BE so didn't think too post it.

I did laugh though.

when you don't say things because others might be offended the thought police have got to you.

What I don't get is why this was news, the names of the pilots sat in the left and right seat were released by Asiana themselves the day of the crash.

Which is further proof (as if any were needed) that the vast majority of people working in the "news" media in the US are morons... <img src="http://britishexpats.com/forum/images/smilies/sad.gif"/>

Exactly.. That's why it's funny, it makes the TV station and their news dept. look really stupid. Sorry, but I don't really see what is racist about making up a silly name such as Sum Ting Wong.. it is mildly funny in a wacky way but the person who read the list on air without seeing what's up is an idiot.

imo its playing on stereotypes rather being truly racist...

I like what someone posted elsewhere -
"You all are missing the bigger issue.....Sure, I laughed my ass off too (despite the tragedy and loss of life), however the bigger issue is that this is just more evidence that we cannot trust ANYTHING that the mainstream media reports.. She says it TWICE..... "THE NTSB CONFIRMED the names of the pilots on board Aisiana Flight 214" PATHETIC!!! The Media has ZERO Credibility. They are paid shills...paid to report the narrative of the agenda...in this case they were fooled by an intern prank".

Shills indeed, even more highlighted by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hh_Kx7UKndI">O'Brien</a>

My stepdad's a pilot. I asked him today if he'd still fly on a 787 - he said yes.

It just shows you, 'news-readers' really are that 'readers' -- totally devoid of common sense! Kudos to who got it through though!

Apparently the intern was served with a Notice of Legal Action by Asianas lawyer, Mi-Su You.

We've crossed the streams here, lads. The Asiana crash was a 7 7 7. Dear, oh dear *shakes head in despair* <img src="http://britishexpats.com/forum/images/smilies/biggrin.gif"/>

That news item though, looks like a joke by the visual effects department that went a bit farther than intended. Gallows humour and all that, anyone that got 'offended' by it should really grow up a bit.

I'm well aware of that <img src="http://britishexpats.com/forum/images/smilies/tongue.gif"/>

Asiana now saying they will definitely sue 'because of damage to their reputation'....

...... as if four of their pilots flying a perfectly good aircraft into the ground didnt damage it enough already.
