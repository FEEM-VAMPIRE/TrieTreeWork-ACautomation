I remember commenting to my wife that it was disgusting how Nigella can continue to work in the US despite her admitting in court that she has abused cocaine.

Turns out the Americans aren't allowing her to travel using the VWP:

How do the DM come to the conclusion she was on a VWP? She clearly works while in the USA, so presumably has a visa allowing her to do so.

From the sounds of it she had quite a good relationship with cocaine <img src="http://britishexpats.com/forum/images/smilies/smile.gif"/>

They're reporting that she registered to travel using ESTA. I can't comment on the accuracy of that; like all things DM it could be complete bald-locks.

Storm - teacup?

If everyone that was known to have taken drugs, but never convicted of such, were prohibited from entering the US there would be a lot of people that would never get in.

A little bit more info here on the visa/visa waiver requirements:

<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/apr/03/nigella-lawson-stopped-boarding-flight-us-cocaine-confession">http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandst...ine-confession</a>

I feel sorry for her tbh if it is true what Nigella said about taking coke twice in her life; I used to read the weekly articles in "The Times" written by her late husband John Diamond about trying to endure throat cancer. It was dreadfully sad reading about how he was suffering - and no way would I ever condone drug taking - I think I can understand why Nigella said in Court that she took cocaine with her husband.

Her ex-spouse Charles Saatchi was almost certainly a bully and her self-esteem must have been in the gutter. I imagine that she just wanted to have some kind of brief respite and stupidly took cocaine again.

It is odd that other 'celebs' have openly admitted or been photographed taking drugs, yet they have no problem entering the US: eg. Ozzy Osbourne, Elton John, Keith Richards (and probably other members of the 'Stones') Kate Moss and even ex-heroin addict Russell Brand.... <img src="http://britishexpats.com/forum/images/smilies/blink.gif"/> Paul McCartney was even detained in a cell in Japan for having drugs (marijuana) but he seems to be very welcome in the States.

I reckon that Nigella will be back in the States soon, isn't the 'O' visa for members of the sports &amp; entertainment industry?
