"Richard Langdon, a Portland man forcibly ejected from a Clackamas County commission meeting last month for disruptive behavior, won a 9 mm Glock pistol Tuesday night in a campaign fundraiser raffle held by former state representative Tootie Smith, who is running for a seat on the county commission."

I love this country.

Great isn't it. I watched the meeting he was ejected from, for trying to sit in silence during his three minutes of allotted time to address the Board of Commissioners during public participation.

Jim Bernard started the clocked and Richard started an argument that the clock couldn't be started until he started to speak. So Jim had the deputy throw the guy out.

Would this count as freedom of (political) expression? That would take in 1st AND 2nd Amendment rights in one move!! <img src="http://britishexpats.com/forum/images/smilies/eek.gif"/>

Well, his arrest would be governed by the 4th amendment. At trial, he would have 5th and 6th amendments to protect him. Upon conviction, his punishment would be limited by the 8th amendment. A shooting would provide a wonderful civics lesson!

Speaking of civics lessons, two years ago, this guy was obviously inspired by democracy when he shot up a school board meeting in Florida:

It's good to live free, isn't it. I wonder if he won it in a raffle?

And how long do you give it before someone pops on here to say that if there had been someone in the audience with a gun, they could have shot him?

I'm going to ruin all of the fun, because he was shot by a school board security guard (either an ex- or off-duty cop, I'm not sure).

It isn't clear to me whether the security guard killed him, or whether he finished himself off. Fortunately, despite firing at close range, the shooter didn't hit anyone.

Hey, this is democracy, he bought his influence for just $5. Bankers and International business persons spend millions. Who got more bang! for the buck. And I guess I question which is more dangerous for democracy?
