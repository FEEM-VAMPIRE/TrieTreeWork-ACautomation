We knew from the beginning that BLM were Soros-funded Commie criminals, built on the hands up don't shoot lie, sprouted like wildfire you'd think Acorn and new black panthers were mob-sourced to participate in an aggressive cancer in America, bent on anarchy and civil unrest, out to create the need for martial law, and guess what? THEY EXPOSED THEMSELVES as the aggressors, demanding that you believe there is a race problem, and there is. A black racism problem, stoking arson and victimhood and pointing to whitey as to who provoked it. These are bad actor's performance art. This is one of George Soros finest handiwork if he could destabilize America as he has other countries.

This guy is in Chicago? Aren't guns with cosmetic assault features banned there? Why does he have these? He should be following the gun control laws.

Holy cow! Worse than I thought.

From the link:
"In all, <a href="http://m.washingtontimes.com/topics/george-soros/">Mr. Soros</a> gave at least $33 million in one year to support already-established groups that emboldened the grass-roots, on-the-ground activists in <a href="http://m.washingtontimes.com/topics/ferguson/">Ferguson</a>, according to the most recent tax filings of his nonprofit <a href="http://m.washingtontimes.com/topics/open-society/">Open Society</a> Foundations.

The financial tether from <a href="http://m.washingtontimes.com/topics/george-soros/">Mr. Soros</a> to the activist groups gave rise to a combustible protest movement that transformed a one-day criminal event in Missouri into a 24-hour-a-day national cause celebre."

Combustible. Effective writing. <img src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" alt=":)"/>

Soros funded organized protests to push Soros's traitorous communist propaganda that the youth are buying into, then they go back to Mommy for support. <img src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" alt=":confused:"/>

But the laughable thing about the *protesters* was seeing all of them protesting while doing selfies..
surreal lol.. the *selfie revolution*. LOL
