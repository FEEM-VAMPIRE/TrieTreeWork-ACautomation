I understand that there's not just a teacher's strike but a lawyer's strike. Since there are all these people who can't be tried while their counsel have downed tools, can't the government force them to care for the displaced children? This would make good use of bodies stuck on remand and serve as a terrifying deterrent for any potential criminals.

Wont this end up costing the government more then just settling? Or is it some sort of bribe to parents to put pressure on teachers by trying to get parents to be less supportive?

Not sure how many parents are supportive of the teachers any more. It seems to me - and almost all the other parents who have an opinion - that this is all about money. The teachers have said it's all about the kids, but the first thing on their agenda is their pay-rise. If it was all about class sizes etc, sort that first and put their wage demands on the back burner - at least to get the kids back into school.

$40 doesn't buy a full day childcare for one child in this part of the world. Doubt it does in BC either.

It doesn't around my part of BC, seems the starting rate for drop in day cares is 60+ per day.

It's certainly based on money at-least for the teachers I have heard talking around town.

Spending more than the cost of settling never seems to bother governments when they can move against a union.

I don't think that any parent in their right mind would want their kids being looked after by criminals.

That is true. Still boggles my mind the Liberals won re-election, didn't see possible leading up to the polls, but I guess voters are skittish of the NDP still because of the 90's.

I'm sure this will result in a surge in illegal childminders/daycares.

Less supportive of who? The parent I talk to support the govt. not the teachers. All this crap about doing it for the kids. If this was the case then why have the picket lines come down during summer and will go back up when kids are due to get schooling?
