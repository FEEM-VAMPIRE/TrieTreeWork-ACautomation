Awaiting Trump Riot In Chicago

Trump's rally in Chicago has been postponed due to protesters both inside and outside the venue. Small fights have already broken out. Fun times.

Well, when you piss off the electorate for whom you need their vote, and have to travel to where that electorate lives, you have to deal with the consequences that the fruit made by your rhetoric bears.

I wonder how much personal responsibility Trump's campaign will take for this (though I already know the answer).

Good. How many times in history did a leader rise to power on this kind of hateful rhetoric and people only wished they stood up to him before it was too late?

Hispanic and Islam are not races. YAWN.

I don't see Cruz or Trump or any GOP candidate supporters crashing Bernie and Hillary rallies. It's always the paid protestors/agitators from the left. Always.

Trump paid to have a rally and the thugs who are butthurt that Trump is ultra popular in Democrat bastion Chicago get their panties in a wad and have to disrupt the rally.

When those idiots started trespassing, I hope that the Trump supporters gave them plenty of punches to the face!

Trump shows how much he hates everyone but white men then denys it and the violence he promotes at his rally.

No they were not, and are not.

It's all in the progressive's mind...racists everywhere OMG...surrounding us...OMG...safe rooms and safe zones for everyone...but promote race violence because blacks cannot be racists.

Seriously, persecution paranoid sheeple behavior, and very un-American.

Again, a sucker-punching old guy in North Carolina proves contrary to your statement.

As I said earlier, Trump rally's are dangerous!!! I've been to one and it was 11K inside the arena, and 5K people just standing outside and a (s) load of protestors! It was ridiculous...so many people were arguing and causing all types of problems.
