It's always about the kids. They are top priority. Except when pensions are concerned. <img src="http://britishexpats.com/forum/images/smilies/wink.gif"/>

Expected this to happen.

The whole situation is a mess, they can't even find someone willing to be a mediator..

that to me is very telling. Not even Vince Reddy is willing, which is saying a lot.

And yet somehow this dysfunctional gong-show is helping the kids. aaaaalrighty then.

I have a friend of mine who's a teacher and quite a keeny unionised one at that. He had a summer of summer school work lined up to supplement his meagre $70k+ 10 monthly salary. He doesn't seem so keen on the strike any more - now he's going to loose the money he'd earn on top of his "normal" salary.

I just didn't say anything, but I think he's reflecting on just how much his stance of standing up for the kids ('cos that's what it's all about) is going to cost him.

How financially sound is the union? Could the government be attempting to prolong the strike in an effort to bankrupt the BCTF?

the word on the street is that the bctf has millions locked away.

however, maybe they're trying to financially squeeze the teachers...which would seem to be working

one kindergarten teacher has approached the after school care i use for work already....

You have to feel bad for teachers who are expected to survive on that kind of salary. Good job there are food bank being set up for them!

Grocery stores in California did that about 10 years ago, they let the strike drag on for months, used management to run the stores, customers kept coming, and after about 4 months or so without pay, the employees settled, and really got nothing in return.

Northwest Airlines played hard ball with their mechanics who went on strike, those workers never got their job back, after 2 years or so the union called off the strike when it was clear the airline was never going to settle.

Yoga will allow then to stretch after all that standing and placard holding!

Summer schools should apply for LMO's for teachers.. shouldn't be too hard to prove there are no Canadians willing to take the job <img src="http://britishexpats.com/forum/images/smilies/tongue.gif"/>

Another strike in BC? It seems like not a year goes by without there being some strike.

They're less likely to grant LMOs if there is an ongoing labour dispute.

What's nice is that they're giving HID and her mob an extra big chunk of change because all the extra work they've had to do. Cheers BCTF <img src="http://britishexpats.com/forum/images/smilies/beer.gif"/>
