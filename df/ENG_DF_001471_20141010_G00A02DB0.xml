I bought a <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-6/">iPhone 6</a> plus space grey and found someone that will trade for his iphone 6 plus in silver.
We both bought our phones at apple and both have applecare. We will be meeting at an apple store to make sure each others phones are good to go.

The only thing im unsure of is the fact that my phone was purchased via att next. Will thie cause any problems with our trade?

I was told that we could both cancel our applecares at the apple store then repurchase the applecare after the trade.

I would just return it straight up at apple store but they don't stock a silver 6 plus anywhere near my city.

Ask your carrier.

Went to the apple store and completed the trade. It was no problem.
We ran the diagnostics, returned our applecare and repurchased applecare under our new phones and called it a day.
