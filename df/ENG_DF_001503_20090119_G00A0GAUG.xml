He had a dream...

On MLK day, all the media seem to be going on about is "does Obama's election mean MLK's dream came true?"

The very fact that they have to still ask that question tells me "no".

Thoughts?

He's a bi-racial politician. He was the best choice out of the two.....and quite frankly I don't think he can walk on water - don't want him to, just want him to try and figure out the mess that Bush left behind.

Walking on water is probably the easier of the two.

You asked about "his" election - and I made comment on "him" Has MLK's dream come true? That a bi-racial politician has been elected president? I don't know, I suppose. How's that?

Agree. I don't have much knowledge of USA politics but I don't recall anyone mentioning the colour of Bush's skin when he was elected.

So you read half the question and then replied to a questioin which hadn't been posed... OK... some things never change.

If you didn't have an opinion, why post at all? <img src="http://britishexpats.com/forum/images/smilies/confused.gif"/>

I thought he was 43.

Bush and the thoughts of Mc Cain/Palin frightened the US so much the forgot about being racist

GWB was/is the 43rd president. According to your post, of his 42 predecessors, 41 had the same colour skin as him. What about the other one?

Ping! Gerald Ford was not elected.... <img src="http://britishexpats.com/forum/images/smilies/redface.gif"/>

Bush is the "43rd president" but there have only been 42 actual presidents, including Gerald Ford.

Good quiz question, this......

Because I'm annoyed that this is all tied into MLK in the first place. Yes, he's the first "black" president....but so much hoopla is being made over an elected politician for christsakes! Don't get me wrong, I'm glad he won, I voted for him. But I didn't vote for him because he was a black man, I voted for him because he was the better (IMO) of the two.

Yes I know this is not really answering your question.....Is this fulfilling MLK's dream? The fact that he was elected, perhaps, the fact that he can run a government, one that's screwed up royally, well I guess we'll see.
