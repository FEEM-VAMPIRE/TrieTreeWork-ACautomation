As far as Trump’s concerned, this is a fool’s errand. Not just undeterred but apparently emboldened by his critics, Trump continues to plow through the primaries with <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/711275596626665472">supporters following his lead</a>.

I can't say for sure it's the leftist machine who is doing this since the GOP has worked pretty hard to take Trump down.

Someone should maybe tell them protesting is okay, but blocking a road is unlawful. Bunch of morons.

You are delusional. The left doesn't know how to protest without violence, so we see violence at Trump events. There is no more hated or mistrusted politician than Hillary.

Soros is paying for it - and I you can bet many of these guys are actually paid protesters. You can make a decent living traveling around the country working for moveon.org. I've known a guy for 20 years who protests for a living. I'm sure he was both there and in Chicago.

Bought and paid for by Trump himself no doubt. He's a savvy pol and knows these "leftist" thugs will draw voters to Trump's cause.

Wait wait wait. What you're saying is that if we found out Trump hired a bunch of people to protest violently at his own rallies, this would be, like, what? A bold and ballsy political maneuver?
