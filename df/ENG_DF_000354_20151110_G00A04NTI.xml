Excellent. Good for southern Oregon. "All" the communists and by far the most populous part of the state is the Wlllamette Valley from Eugene and north to Portland. Southern Oregon is like a whole other state. It's also the state that elected both Dennis Smith and Ron Wyden in the same election. It can be a wild card.

John Adams said "We are a Country of laws, not of men"
The truth is that the ruling class gets to choose what laws will be enforced. Go after the guns but don't worry about sanctuary cities etc.
The sheriff is on the side of the Constitution, that's what should matter.
