What fair independent group would ever recommend any pay rise to any politician anywhere? It always sound ridiculous when they compare their salaries to those in other jobs, suggesting they are sacrificing and are not greedy. I remember Bertie Ahern, former Taosieach of Ireland defending a pay rise saying he has to buy his own tea bags.

I didn't vote him in. Didn't like him before. Don't like him now. I won't vote for him next time. Meanwhile here in the real world we're stuck with him. Not really anything to do with politics, it's the fact the man is an incompetent ****wit who hasn't got a clue what he's doing.

A democratically elected incompetent ****wit - by a massive majority

He's going to win the next election too

One of the great things about 1st world democracies is that you accept the elected government - even if you didn't vote for them or agree with their policies. Just look at the socialist assholes I had governing me in the UK from 1997 and here between 2007 and 2012 - terrible, destructive, irresponsible governments, but I accept that they were democratically elected

It's actually better than that apparently. All of the cronies with him have their pay set pro rata from his - so they ALL get a 21% pay rise.

Combined with the unedifying performance of the libs and their stooge at the federal level today and you really have to ask how low they can stoop. So far it seems there is no bottom to their talents.

Your view on politics always seems to come across as a 'win at all costs, screw the damage' attitude where the government are not at fault, it's the voters who should shoulder he blame. It's not very democratic if the options you base your vote on are just smokescreens. Having the option to 'vote them out' is the biggest insult to citizens of a democratic society when we can't have decent representation and where are single option is to vote.

Simple voters like simple choices.
