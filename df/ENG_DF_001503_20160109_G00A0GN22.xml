This whole "story" is a bit odd and inconsequential. She wants to own a gun to keep at home and protect her and her family. This is allowed. What's this got to do with President Obama's new proposals?

You don't start with an outright ban, you slowly chip away at the right to own guns. The proposals are the beginning of a long road ahead.

I thought her question to Obama a trifle odd too.
I came up with two conclusions:
1) She doesn't read/listen to the proposals, preferring only to listen to her political representative's poster campaigns.
2) She's mentally unbalanced and, because of her medical record, bought her gun/s from somewhere that didn't require background checks.

I'm leaning towards #2.

That's true I suppose. Similar to banning private car ownership, they started out by making seat belts compulsory.

Let me think.... hmmmmm

How about anywhere that a background check isn't required, would you like a list of types of sellers that can sell guns under those conditions?

What exactly is the point of making shops perform background checks if private sellers don't have to??? Anybody who wants a gun but wants to remain under the radar doesn't need an IQ of much more than 40 to work out where not to buy one.

So what is all the palaver about private individuals who sell a gun at a gun show?
When I use the term 'gun seller' I assume it to mean a person that sells a gun/guns regardless of their business status

Ask Obama.

If I want to buy a gun from my Neighbour, who actually has one I would like, I need to pass a background check.

I guess he could sell it to me illegally, pretty sure he would not.

Nothing more than a silly call to emotion, that I can see.

We can agree on that.
