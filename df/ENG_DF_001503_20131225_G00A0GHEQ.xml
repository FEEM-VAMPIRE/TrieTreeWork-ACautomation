Santa got me a poor mans computer, but what are they good for? I could put xbmc on it and celotape it to the TV. Any other suggestions?

A good thing to put on the pi is XBMC (google it !). It turns it in to a media centre. From there you can manage all your photos/videos and even watch live TV (including BBC).

Hope this post doesn't get deleted for spam (because it's not spam!). Just trying to help the original poster.

Yes XBMC is an amazing thing to run on that little computer.

I have run XBMC for a long time, so it made sense to put Raspbmc on an SD Card.

I have OpenVPN setup on another for secure access back to my LAN from public wifi hotspots.

I going to start working on OwnCloud tomorrow so my most important data (US Visa included <img src="http://britishexpats.com/forum/images/smilies/smile.gif"/> ) is backed up on more than one device. Which also doubles up as a LAMP box, for my private wiki.

Yes I'm an IT geek. So sorry if this is too much info.

If all else fails, as mentioned it's plenty powerful for Mame and some other gaming.

Can you recommend a good USB Wifi adapter for it?

Sorry I cannot, I forget now what mine is. Though I did buy mine from a Pi retailer. This is probably your best bet.

I might be looking at a Model B to use XBMC. Should i get a regular Ubuntu distribution or go with XBMCbuntu. What do you use for media storage with the Pi? I would like to have a huge movie collection stored on a HDD ideally (either connected or on a server over wifi). The only other thing i would likely like to use it for is MAME, but then i see the RetroPlayer feature in XBMC is going to support MAME ROMs and others.

Some other questions

Is it possible to use a game controller?
Does XBMC have some kind of remote control or does it need the Pi keyboard and mouse attached all the time?

Don't muck about - all the dependencies are just sorted out for you on the XBMCbuntu disk.

The OpenElec system in NOOBS comes with XBMC and is all ready to go, just needs your sources adding.

I am using a Network storage drive with a wireless thumb. Also using a remote control from a Windows Media Center PC, it works out of the box.
