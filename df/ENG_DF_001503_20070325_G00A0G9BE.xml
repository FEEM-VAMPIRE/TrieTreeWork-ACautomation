I'm a MH nurse in Cairns, just up the road. I got a job in Townsville on the secure unit there, but took the Cairns job because they came through for me first and I prefer Cairns as a place to live.

At Christmas they had a riot on the secure unit and nurses ended up in A&amp;E. Now I'm not saying it's a terrible place to work, but I have been warned off working there.

There is a Rehab place in Townsville called Kirwan which is supposed to be good; we refer a lot of our clients there. You might want to check if they have vacancies.

Townsville is the centre of nursing, including MH nursing for the Northern Zone which includes Cairns, and gets the lion's share of the money which is why we're starved of funds here in Cairns. Having said that, I work on the unit here at the Base hospital and the staff here are great, but the pressure on beds is huge. It's a good place to work mind (so far...) <img src="http://britishexpats.com/forum/images/smilies/smile.gif"/>

Good luck, whatever you decide! <img src="http://britishexpats.com/forum/images/smilies/sunglasses.gif"/>
